##Short Description
I'm going to use the above dataset from the image to predict the price of the car.


##what's the problem?
#Car Pricing
Predicting car price using variable such as price range,car style,milage,vehile type,transmission type,keep the price of the car according to the market trend by planning in the initial stage itself and cam continue design 

##How can technology help?
By knowing the best price range the company can launch the car with the price that people would be expecting

                   
   if required i will use LDA and finally i will be using linear regression model
   by train,test split method using sklearn library and also i will make the data structured
   as it contains many NAN values and unordered set of values that cannot be taken into a model,
   finally if someone wants to know the market trend according to the car they want to launch,
   they can plan and design according to the price range in the initial stage itself, so that
   it could end as profitable initiative
