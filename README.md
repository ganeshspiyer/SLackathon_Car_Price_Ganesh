##Short Description

                    I'm going to use the above dataset from the image to predict the price of the car.


##what's the problem?

#Car Pricing

            Predicting car price using variable such as price range,car style,milage,vehile type,transmission type,keep the price of the car according to the market trend by planning in the initial stage itself and can continue design 

##How can technology help?

                             By knowing the best price range the company can launch the car with the price that people would be expecting and one can quickly fix the price range for the car

##The Idea
          Using the available historical data one can train the ML model and one can accurately decide the price range that people could accept, as they have bought the particular car of same price range in the past.
          
##Project road map:  
                       As of now i'm using Jupyter notebook, if required i will use LDA 
                       and finally i will be using linear regression model by train,test split method 
                       using sklearn library and also i will make the data structured
                       as it contains many NAN values and unordered set of values that cannot be taken into a model.
                       Will try watson studio for Auto AI model selection and will try with deployment through
                       IBM cloud.
