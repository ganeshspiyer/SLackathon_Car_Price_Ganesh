Hi,
   i'm going to use the above dataset from the image to predict the price of the car,
   if required i will use LDA and finally i will be using linear regression model
   by train,test split method using sklearn library and also i will make the data structured
   as it contains many NAN values and unordered set of values that cannot be taken into a model,
   finally if someone wants to know the market trend according to the model they wants to launch,
   so they can plan according the price range
